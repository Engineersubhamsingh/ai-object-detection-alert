# 🛡️ AI Object Detection with Smart Alert System

A real-time web-based AI application that uses your device’s webcam to detect objects using **TensorFlow.js (COCO-SSD)** model.  
It intelligently triggers an alarm when both a **knife** and a **person** are detected — acting as a basic **safety surveillance system**.
